TODO

  * FIND sim.spatialHDS! (NB not the same a sim.spatialDS.)

  * Stop simNmix, playRN spewing out warnings.

  * Add information about the plots to the help pages.

  * Write/check Value sections for simHDS, simHDSopen, wigglyOcc help pages.

  * Deal with remaining NOTEs from R CMD check:
    = use of 'tits' as default for map.Nmix.resi.
    = foreign function call to a different package ("nll_pcount" in "unmarked").
    = apparent S3 methods: image.scale, plot.Nmix.resi.
    
  * Finish debugging simHDSopen("point",...)

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9009

  * Many small fixes prompted by going through the AHM1 code with the last
  version.

  * Counts displayed as a histogram-like plot, with 2 colours if necessary.

  * 'match.arg' now used throughout the code.

  * Fixed bug in simHDSg("point",...).

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9008

  * All simulation functions that produce plots have a 'show.plot' argument and restore previous 'par' and 'devAskNewPage' settings on exit.

  * 'image.scale' is defunct and replaced with 'image_scale'.

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9007

  * simComm restores previous 'par' and 'devAskNewPage' settings on exit

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9006

  * New function simDynocc to replace simDynocc.fn

  * image.scale no longer exported, as it is seen by R as a method for the S3 generic 'image'.

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9005

  * simDynocc.fn get show.plot argument

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9004

  * Added simDCM and more help pages

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9001

  * Took out Nhat and data.fn for chapter 21.

  * Fixed bugs in other functions due to 'logit'.

  * Fixed some of the warnings about R code generated by R CMD check.

  * Changed unmarked from Imports to Depends; removed the jay data set, which duplicates that in unmarked.

CHANGES in 0.1.0.9000

  * Changed version numbering; the final '9nnn' indicates a development version (suggestion of Hadley Wickham).

  * Changed NAMESPACE export command to explicitely export functions.

  * Split the monster file AHM_funcs_30_11_2015.r into smaller files for each function.

  * Fixed bug in simComm due to call to 'logit'.
