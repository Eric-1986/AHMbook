# AHMbook
The first volume of the book *Applied Hierarchical Modeling in Ecology: Analysis of distribution, abundance and species richness in R and BUGS* by Marc Kery and Andy Royle appeared early in 2016. They are now working on the second volume. See the [book web page](http://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/).

A number of R functions are needed to complement the code in the book, and these are included in an R package, AHMbook, with version 0.01 released in December 2015 and available for download from the book web site. This version was considered a preliminary version, and in particular most of the functions were undocumented. Writing good documentation is time-consuming, and Marc and Andy have been focusing on the next volume, so I have offered to help with this aspect.
